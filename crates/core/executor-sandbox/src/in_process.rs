//! Built-in providers linked into the embedding process.
//!
//! An embedder that links sandbox-driver's Host, Docker, or Daytona provider
//! hands Petri a [`ProviderFactory`] per kind in [`InProcessProviders`]. The
//! standard router then reaches those providers directly instead of
//! launching their plugins. Everything else is unchanged: the lease manager
//! still records a verified fingerprint before any resource exists, fences a
//! recovered sandbox once, and applies retention; prune still deletes
//! through the durable records.
//!
//! A router with in-process providers never launches a provider plugin: a
//! kind with no factory fails routably at acquire. A router without them
//! reaches every provider through its plugin, as before.
//!
//! `InProcessSource` is one factory's provider for one run: connected on
//! first use and health-checked before it serves, like a plugin's first
//! generation.
