//! The non-secret backend identity every lease records.
//!
//! A fingerprint names the resource namespace a provider drives: the Host
//! registry, the Docker daemon endpoint, or the Daytona account and target.
//! It is recorded on every lease and checked before a recorded sandbox is
//! touched again, so a resume or prune against a different backend refuses
//! instead of acting on the wrong resources.
//!
//! The seed is the same whichever way the provider is reached, a plugin or
//! an in-process factory, so a lease recorded one way is recoverable the
//! other. It is built from the settings as configured, not as the provider
//! resolves them: an unset value stays unset (`None`) rather than becoming
//! the default the provider falls back to, because that is what a plugin
//! records. The first health report's identity, when the provider gives
//! one, is appended to the seed ([`verified`]).
