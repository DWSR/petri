//! `petri sandbox prune`: delete every sandbox a finished or abandoned run
//! still holds on its provider.
//!
//! A lease that was never released — a crash, a kill, a `Retention::Always`
//! run — leaves a stopped or running sandbox and its workspace on the
//! provider. The run's resource records say exactly which. Prune opens the
//! run for writing, so no coordinator can resume it meanwhile, checks each
//! record's provider fingerprint against the provider it reaches (a changed
//! daemon or account is a configuration error, never a delete on another
//! backend), writes the delete intent before the provider call, and leaves
//! a tombstone after. Each provider deletes its sandbox's managed workspace,
//! including Host workspaces under the run directory.
